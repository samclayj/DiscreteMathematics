Down-load the Java Development Kit using a browser (lynx, Internet explorer,
Netscape), go to the site http://www.javasoft.com and select "Java Development
Kit." You need to download the JDK1.1.4 <I>or later</I> for your machine,
probably Microsoft's Windows 95/NT but various UNIX platforms support Java.
If you are running Windows 3.1, you must go to the IBM site and look there:
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com (this site does not work usefully with lynx).
For Windows 3.1 you are looking for IBM’s ADK for Java 1. 1 or later

<P>From home, be prepared for several hours download time (try overnight).

<P>The file is a self-extracting executable. It should install into the
directory C:\jdk1.1.4 (or later). Check the installation notes if you are
using IBM’s ADK.

<P>If you plan to develop programs in Java, download the "api documentation"
and unzip it <B>using a 32-bit (long file name) "unzipper</B>." Unzip to
C:\ with directory options on; in this way it unzips to C:\jdk1.1.4\docs
(or later). Also download the Java tutorial when you can (Binghamton students
should let me know if they cannot find the tutorial.zip file). The tutorial
has to be unzipped into the directory it will use, e.g., C:\jdk1.1.4\tutorial.

When you type in the command window (MS-DOS window on Windows 95/NT and
an X-Term window on Solaris)
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="Courier">java FSM</FONT></LI>
</UL>
you will see the frame shown in <A HREF="fsm1.gif">Figure 1</A>.

<P>If you click on "Machine" in the Menu Bar, you pull down the options
"New Machine" and "Restart," as shown in <A HREF="fsm2.gif">Figure 2</A>.

<P>When you click on "New Machine," you get a File Dialog Box, which allows
you to open a file that contains a description of the finite state machine
that you are about to test, see <A HREF="fsm3.gif">Figure 3</A>.

<P>You select and open the appropriate file. The format for the file is
described later. The simulator will load and display the states of the
machine and the transitions between the states, see <A HREF="fsm4.gif">Figure
4</A>. If there are detectable errors in the format of your machine these
will be reported in your command window. Resize the window to allow you
to spread out the states in the black area on the screen. The states are
distributed at random on the screen and you can drag them with the mouse
to any location in the black area, <A HREF="fsm5.gif">Figure 5</A>.

<P>Next you should insert an input string. If you do not, the input will
be assumed to be the empty string. To insert an input string, click in
the empty text field next to the label "Input." Type in the input string,
<A HREF="fsm6.gif">Figure 6</A>, and click the button "Accept Input Tape"
OR hit enter <A HREF="fsm7.gif">Figure 7</A>.

<P>The control bar allows you to proceed one step at a time (by pressing
"Step") or run continuously at different speeds (by pressing one of the
smaller buttons, which will show up red). See <A HREF="fsm8.gif">Figure
8</A>.

<LI>
There is a special feature that allows the machine to run in reverse, thereby

possible after the machine halts (either in an accepting or a non-accepting
state)</LI>

<LI>
The number of transition steps executed so far is shown in a message next
to the "Accept Input Tape" button</LI>

<LI>
This message is replaced with an "ACCEPTED" or "Not accepted" message when
the machine halts. <A HREF="fsm8.gif">Figure 8</A> shows the machine running,
<A HREF="fsm9.gif">Figure 9</A> shows the machine when it accepts the input

accept an input</LI>

<LI>
The command window will also show a final status message when the machine
completes</LI>

The FSM simulator also allows you to introduce a "New Input," which is
selected under "Options" on the menu bar, and to "Restart" the machine
with the same input, which is selected under "Machine" on the menu bar.

<A NAME="specialnote"></A>SPECIAL NOTE ON NFA SIMULATIONS</H3>
In this version, the NFA simulation is really a demonstration of the DFA
derived from the NFA. The states of this DFA are subsets of states of the
NFA. The initial state appears as the epsilon-closure (lambda-closure)
of the initial state, <A HREF="fsm13.gif">Figure 13</A>. Each transition
moves to a new set of states, taking the epsilon-closure (lambda-closure)
each time, <A HREF="fsm14.gif">Figure 14</A>. The input is accepted if
the set contains a final state, <A HREF="fsm15.gif">Figure 15</A>.

<A NAME="grader"></A>The course-grader's quick-to-use version of the Simulator</H3></CENTER>
When a course grader is presented with a large number of FSM text files
to check, one time saving approach is to run all the FSM's against a set
of test inputs. The grader should prepare a file with a number of test
cases, for example the file <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A> shown
below. The first line (300) is an upper limit on the number of steps that
the simulation can run for [this is for uniformity with the Turing machine
simulator, where machines might run for ever]. The second line (16) is
the total number of test cases in the file. Lines 3 through 18 are the
test cases. Line 3 is a blank line representing the empty string.

To run the grader's version, type the following:
<PRE><TT>java GraderFSM</TT></PRE>
or
<PRE><TT>java GraderFSM inputd1.txt</TT></PRE>
or
<PRE><TT>java GraderFSM inputd1.txt dfa1.txt</TT></PRE>
If the command-line parameters are not provided, there will be prompts
to ask for them.
<BR>In the example below, the grader is working in the directory "fsm_source"
and types in the name of the common set of test cases in the file <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A>.
Then there is a prompt for the next FSM to test. In this example, the machine
file <A HREF="dfa1.txt">dfa1.txt</A> was used. The following lines give
the test results: "YES" means the current input was accepted, "NO" means
that the end of the current input was reached but the input was not accepted
and "Machine exception, ..." indicates that the simulation was suspended
before the end of the current input string because the necessary transition
was not defined in the automaton (this third possibility is quite normal).
After checking whether the tests match the correct responses, the program
asks for another FSM file to test (against the same test inputs) so that
the grader can run through all the solutions to a specific problem.

<A NAME="shortform"></A>The short-form of the text-only version of the
Simulator</H3></CENTER>
A second text-only versions is designed to let a student work at an ASCII
terminal, typically through a dial-up connection, which normally prevents
the use of the GUI version. To run the simpler version, simply type one
of the following:
<PRE>java QuickTextFSM</PRE>
or
<PRE>java QuickTextFSM inputd1.txt</PRE>
or
<PRE>java QuickTextFSM inputd1.txt dfa1.txt</PRE>
or
<PRE>java QuickTextFSM inputd1.txt dfa1.txt logd1.txt</PRE>
If the parameter "logd1.txt" is not provided, the default is "report.txt."
If the other parameters are not provided, there will be prompts to request
them. The file of test cases <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A> is the
same as before. The following example shows the use of the same FSM <A HREF="dfa1.txt">dfa1.txt</A>,
which was used above.
<PRE>C:\fsm_source>java QuickTextFSM inputd1.txt</PRE>

<PRE>TITLE: NEW MACHINE

<PRE>TITLE: DFA: Example 1--Eileen Head--Language: \ + ...
Ready? return</PRE>
The program reports on whether the FSM accepted a particular input from
the file <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A>, in this case. The reports
come in groups of 5. Examples include the following (the first example
is a test with a blank input):
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUT:
&nbsp; STATUS: DFA: Example 1--Eileen Head--Language: \ + 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 +&nbsp;
1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 ACCEPTED after Step: 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUT: 11110101111110
&nbsp; STATUS: DFA: Example 1--Eileen Head--Language: \ + 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 +&nbsp;
1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 ACCEPTED after Step: 15
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUT: 00
&nbsp; STATUS: DFA: Example 1--Eileen Head--Language: \ + 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 +&nbsp;

&nbsp; STATUS: DFA: Example 1--Eileen Head--Language: \ + 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 +&nbsp;
1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 1* 0 NOT Accepted after Step:8</PRE>
The same information shown on the screen is saved in the log file (default
name: report.txt).

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER>
<H3>
<A NAME="textonly"></A><B>The full text-only version of the finite state
machine simulator</B></H3></CENTER>
For the text-only version, the FSM files are prepared in the same way as
for the graphical version of the simulator. In this case, as before you
need to prepare a file of inputs such as <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A>.
The file was described in the section on the <A HREF="#grader">Grader's
version</A> of the program. The results of the tests will be written to
an output log, which has a default name is "report.txt" but can be modified
by the user. This text-only can be run using one of the following choices:
<PRE>java DetailTextFSM</PRE>
or
<PRE>java DetailTextFSM inputd1.txt</PRE>
or
<PRE>java DetailTextFSM inputd1.txt dfa1.txt</PRE>
or
<PRE>java DetailTextFSM inputd1.txt dfa1.txt logd1.txt</PRE>
If the parameter "logd1.txt" is not provided, the default is "report.txt."
If the other parameters are not provided, there will be prompts to request
them. On the screen the results of each test are shown in exactly the same
way as for the QuickTextFSM program described <A HREF="#shortform">above</A>
(accept/reject/failure on account of a missing transition) with the name
of the machine, the test input, the state where execution ended. The big
difference is in the log file. Note that in this version, after each run
of the simulator, you may also change the FSM, keeping the same input file
(this feature is provided specifically for the grader who might be diagnosing
the failure of students' work).

<P>The format of the log file is shown in the following examples taken
from <A HREF="dfa1.txt">dfa1.txt</A> and <A HREF="inputd1.txt">inputd1.txt</A>

You can see the current state and remaining input at each step of the simulation.
The file is a sequence of snapshots of the simulation, one for each cycle
of the simulator program.

<P>If the user does not get the expected result when viewing the on-screen
report, the log file can be used to isolate which state/input combination
caused the problem.
